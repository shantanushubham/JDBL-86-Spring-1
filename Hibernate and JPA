Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework.
It maps Java classes (entities) to DB tables and Java objects to rows.
Instead of writing raw SQL, you write HQL (Hibernate Query Language) or use methods, and
Hibernate generates SQL under the hood.

JPA (Java Persistence API)
JPA is a specification (a set of interfaces) for ORM in Java.
It defines how to manage data persistence, but does not provide implementation.
Hibernate is the most common implementation of JPA.

JPA -> abstract void addData()
In hibernate -> to create a row in table = addRowToTable()
In rabbitORM -> to create a row in table = createRowInTheTable() [Hypothetical]

Spring Data JPA:
A Spring project that build on JPA to make database access even easier.
It removes boilerplate code by providing repositories (eg. CrudRepository, JpaRepository)
We must define interfaces Spring generates implementations at runtime.
